Hollywood directors like 
Quentin Tarantino often make the old new again.  Retelling stories,
recasting actors from one movie to the next.

Anime is a great example. Like the comics of Marvel and DC, actors are getting in on new mediums. From staring in block busters like The Avengers to doing voice over work.

        I've been canning strawberries for the last few years.  I figured it prudent given that there was a pandemic going on.

Grammy used to can plumb jam. Grandpa still eats it on toast. 

The process of canning involves cleaning the fruit and cutting off any bad spots.

The fruit is heated with sugar.  The sugar is important as it helps the strawberries maintain their color. 

The fruit is then then placed in jars that have undergone an annealing process. If the jars are cooled or heated too quickly, like putting cool jars in a hot caner, they can shatter.  I have not yet had that happen.  I play it safe and follow the proceedure.

The jars then go in a pressure caner. The caner is heated until the water in the caner boils producing steam.  The stream forces out the oxygen from the caner and jars. Additionally, the heat kills bacteria and deactivates enzymes in the fruit.

The batch must be heated for a precise amount of time.

It's a very involved process, but the results are worth it.
