* Secrecy is paramount in warfare and keeping strangers out of your bank account. From simple substitution ciphers to public key cryptography, if you want t
o hide information from prying eyes or curious nephews, you could just give them the answer encrypted.  But for a hint, encryption would be off base.
If your hint were encrypted, you could not get to it. Not in 64 million years.
