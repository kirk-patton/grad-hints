This is a reference to birth of Connor McLeod in Highlander. Yes the date is given in the movie.

The mention of "navigate a ship" is a veiled reference to longitude and latitude.
</details>

* Secrecy is paramount in warfare and keeping strangers out of your bank account. From simple substitution ciphers to public key cryptography, if you want to hide information from prying eyes or curious nephews, you could just give them the answer encrypted.  But for a hint, encryption would be off base. 
If your hint were encrypted, you could not get to it. Not in 64 million years.

<details>
* The hint references "encoding" and mentions the word "base" and "64". It is a vague reference to base64 encoding.  The link within is

* From bell bottoms and chrome on cars to "afros" and behive hairdoos "Wait long enough and everything comes back into style". 

Hollywood directors like, Quentin Tarantino, often make the old new again.  Retelling stories,recasting actors from one movie to the next.

Anime is a great example. Like the comics of Marvel and DC, actors are getting in on new mediums. From staring in block busters like The Avengers to doing voice over work.

(Hint)
* The song Under Pressure was recorded in October of 1981. It was sampled by vanilla ice in the 90's. The song really heated up the music charts.

Rock and rap brought together under pressure. 

Ding ding ding da da ding ding (26)

Ding ding ding da da ding ding (6)

under pressure...

<details>
In the making of steel, iron, and a little carbon, are heated until bright red hot and then hammered in a process known as forging.
The hammer strike "force" the carbon and iron together making a stronger material.

The 26 is the number for iron in the periodic table. 6 is for carbon.

"Ding ding ding da da ding ding" reprsents both the tune from the the song as well as the sound of the hammer on the anvil.
</details>

(Hint)
* A fighter who loses their temper becomes erratic and weak. The thirst for violence cannot be quenched and clouds their thoughts.

(Hint)
I've been canning strawberries for the last few years.  I figured it prudent given that there was a pandemic going on.

Grammy used to can plumb jam. Grandpa still eats it on toast. 

The process of canning involves cleaning the fruit and cutting off any bad spots.

The fruit is heated with sugar.  The sugar is important as it helps the strawberries maintain their color. 

The fruit is then then placed in jars that have undergone an annealing process. If the jars are cooled or heated too quickly, like putting cool jars in a hot caner, they can shatter.  I have not yet had that happen.  I play it safe and follow the proceedure.

The jars then go in a pressure caner. The caner is heated until the water in the caner boils producing steam.  The stream forces out the oxygen from the caner and jars. Additionally, the heat kills bacteria and deactivates enzymes in the fruit.

The batch must be heated for a precise amount of time.

It's a very involved process, but the results are worth it.

<details>
The canning process is made to sound similar to the forging process.  Canning jars do go through an "annealing" process.  This should lead to information on forging.
